- ✅ Force re-initialization for testing

### Production-Ready
- Backward compatible (no breaking changes)
- Minimal performance impact
- Comprehensive error handling
- Clear upgrade path

## 📋 API Stability

All existing APIs remain unchanged:
- `setup_environment()` - Enhanced with better logging
- `get_config()` - No changes
- `is_initialized()` - Added in v0.1.1
- `get_initialization_info()` - Added in v0.1.1

## 🔄 Migration from v0.1.1

**No code changes required!** This is a documentation and testing enhancement release.

Optional improvements you can make:
```python
# Optional: Check initialization status for better debugging
from zero_config import is_initialized, get_initialization_info

if is_initialized():
    print(f"Config initialized by: {get_initialization_info()}")
```

## 📖 Getting Started

### Installation
```bash
pip install zero-config==0.1.2
```

### Quick Start
```python
from zero_config import setup_environment, get_config

# Define your configuration
config = {
    'app_name': 'my_app',
    'database.host': 'localhost',
    'llm.api_key': '',
}

# Initialize (first call wins, subsequent calls ignored)
setup_environment(default_config=config)

# Access anywhere in your app
config = get_config()
print(config.get('app_name'))
```

## 🎯 Use Cases

Perfect for:
- **Web Applications** - FastAPI, Django, Flask apps with complex configuration
- **Data Pipelines** - ETL processes with multiple environment configurations
- **Package Libraries** - Libraries that need configuration but don't want to conflict with main apps
- **Microservices** - Services with layered configuration (defaults → env vars → files)
